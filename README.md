Here is a change Becky made.

Here is another change. I'm adding a line, and also putting a capital 'S' into our header. This change was made in the Becky branch. Adding a new sentence to line 4. Mu also tries to edit line 4. In text editor, I decide to keep both changes, and add a new one. Now what?

Here is a change from the Mu branch. Let's see if I can get both changes. I took the - Mu out of the header, but did not add the uppercase first letter.
